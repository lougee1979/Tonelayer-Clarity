Clarity Beta Testing Agreement

Last updated: July 2026

Thank you for testing ToneLayer Clarity. This agreement covers the ToneLayer Clarity app and the ToneLayer Clarity keyboard extension. By accepting and entering the app you agree to the following.

1. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY — THE APP
ToneLayer Clarity, including its software, code, design, branding, AI prompts, and all associated content, is the exclusive intellectual property of the developer and is protected by copyright law. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, reverse-engineer, decompile, or create derivative works from ToneLayer Clarity or any of its components without explicit written permission from the developer. Unauthorized use constitutes copyright infringement and may result in legal action.

2. YOU OWN WHAT YOU PROCESS
You confirm that you have the right to share and process any text you enter into ToneLayer Clarity or the ToneLayer Clarity keyboard. Do not paste or submit text that belongs to someone else or that you do not have explicit permission to use. ToneLayer Clarity is not responsible for any copyright or intellectual-property claims arising from text you submit.

3. BETA SOFTWARE — NO WARRANTIES
ToneLayer Clarity is beta software. Features may change, crash, or produce unexpected results at any time without notice. Outputs are provided as-is and accuracy is not guaranteed. The developer is not liable for any direct or indirect loss, harm, or misunderstanding resulting from use during the beta period.

4. NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL HELP
ToneLayer Clarity is a communication aid. It is not a medical device, therapy tool, diagnostic service, or source of legal advice. It does not provide clinical, psychological, or legal guidance. If you need professional support, please speak with a qualified professional.

5. YOUR TEXT IS PROCESSED ON OUR SERVER
Before anything leaves your device, the app automatically strips names, phone numbers, addresses, dates, bank account numbers, crypto wallet addresses/private keys/seed phrases, API keys, and any business or trade-secret terms you've added yourself — replacing each with a placeholder. Only the placeholder-substituted text is sent to tonelayer.app for AI processing; the real values are restored on your device once a response returns and are never transmitted or stored. Your text is not permanently stored on the server. This protection is automatic, but it is not a guarantee against every possible leak — stay careful with what you share and who you share it with. By using ToneLayer Clarity you consent to this processing.

6. FEEDBACK
As a beta tester you agree to report bugs, usability issues, and unexpected behavior using the feedback option in the app. Your feedback directly improves the app.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY
Please do not share screenshots or video of beta features publicly without permission from the developer.

8. CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT
This agreement may be updated before general release. You will be asked to re-read and accept any material changes.

If you have questions, contact the developer through the app or at the support email provided on the App Store listing.

Thank you for helping make ToneLayer Clarity better.
